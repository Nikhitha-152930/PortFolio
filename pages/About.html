     <h1> I’m an artist. I make paintings on various items, the person who can make this world look beautiful is an artist one in them.<br></br>
      The mind of the creative genius is a strange and wonderful thing. Not only have great artist shaped culture and the human experience for centuries,  but the artists themselves also have interesting insights as to why they do what they do.<br></br>
      “If I could say it in words there would be no reason to paint.”<br></br> <p></p>
An art business is a profit seeking business related to fine art or commercial art. This includes directly selling art such as an artist who sells works through galleries and business models that produce no art but play some role in the art world such as appraisals.<br></br>
There was a time when art could only be sold in galleries and art exhibitions. Today, with the adoption of digital technology and the internet it’s become a lot easier for aspiring artists to showcase their talent to audiences. The majority of artists now rely on the internet and its modern tools to display and promote their creations. Not only does this help them market their pieces effectively, but it also requires minimal investment on their end. </p> </p>
